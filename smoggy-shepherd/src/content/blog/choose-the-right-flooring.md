# How to Choose the Right Flooring for Your Space

Picking the perfect flooring comes down to traffic, durability needs, and style.

### Popular Options

- Hardwood: classic look, refinishable, adds value
- Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP): durable, water-resistant, cost-effective
- Tile: best for wet areas, wide design variety

> Pro tip: Bring samples into your space and view them at different times of day.
